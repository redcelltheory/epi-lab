# 🔬 The Red Cell Theory — Epi-Lab Repository

Welcome to the Epi-Lab, the public research hub of The Red Cell Theory! This repository is dedicated to to our research conducted in a participatory manner with our community. I believe in open science and transparency, containing shared datasets, statistical scripts, and results from our various participatory research initiatives.

## 🌐 What's in this Repository?

This repository houses all the components of our research projects, from raw data to final reports. The structure is designed to make our methods and findings as clear and reproducible as possible.

-   **`datasets/`**: Contains the data for our studies. We separate `raw/` data (the original, unaltered files) from `cleaned/` data (files that have been processed for analysis).
-   **`documentation/`**: Includes essential information for understanding the datasets, such as data dictionaries (explaining variables) and codebooks.
-   **`methods/`**: Holds documents detailing our research methodologies, including study protocols and the questionnaires used for data collection.
-   **`results/`**: The outputs of our analyses. This includes `graphics/` (plots, charts) and `reports/` (summaries, articles).
-   **`scripts/`**: Contains the code (e.g., in R or Python) used to clean the data and perform the statistical analyses, ensuring our results can be independently verified.

## 🛠️ Tools & Formats

-   **Data Files**: Primarily in `.csv` or `.json` formats.
-   **Scripts**: Mostly written in `R`, `Python` or `Stata`.
-   **Documents**: In Markdown (`.md`) or PDF (`.pdf`) format.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a participatory project, and we welcome contributions! Whether it's suggesting a new analysis, helping to clean data, or providing feedback on our methods, your input is valuable. Please see the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file for more details on how to get involved. If you have questions or ideas, feel free to open an issue.
